# Youssouf Store

## Overview

Welcome to Youssouf Store! This marks my inaugural venture into React.js, and I created this project in late 2021. I've crafted a responsive web application by harnessing the capabilities of various technologies and libraries. The project dynamically displays products fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products).

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yogue1997/youssouf-store.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd youssouf-store
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
